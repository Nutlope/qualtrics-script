You are invited to participate in this online research survey entitled, Understanding the Ecology of Immigrant Families and their Integration into Camden City: Multiple Systems for Health and Well-Being of Young Children from Birth to Age 5.  You are included in this survey because you are a State level administrator who oversees and supervises supports for children from first or second generation immigrant families in the birth-5 age range.  A rough estimate of few hundred participants across 50 states will be asked to participate in completing this one-time survey. The State level administrator survey may take approximately 10 minutes to complete.  Your participation is voluntary. If you do not wish to participate in this survey, do not respond to this online survey.  Completing this survey indicates that you are voluntarily giving consent to participate in the survey.  We expect this survey to remain open until December 1, 2020.   

 

The purpose of this research study is to better understand the extent to which stakeholders and families perceive existing and desired systems and supports for immigrant families of young children. More specifically, our objectives include:

●      Understanding family and child health development and well-being in context

●      Pinpointing key partners and identifying interactions across systems of support (mapping their ecology)

●      Assessing family satisfaction with and use of available supports

●      Understanding views on stakeholder accountability and coordination needs

 

There are no risks or discomforts associated with this survey.  There may be no direct benefit to you, however, by participating in this study, you may help us understand the ways in which we can pinpoint and address roadblocks that may impede capacity building and outreach efforts.  Your response will be kept confidential.  We will store the de-identified data in a secure computer file.  Any part of the research that is published as part of this study will not include your individual information or the name of your particular place of employment.  If you have any questions, contact Dr. Nicole Edwards at EdwardsN@rowan.edu, or Dr. Zeynep Ercan at ercan@rowan.edu, but you do not have to give your personal identification.
